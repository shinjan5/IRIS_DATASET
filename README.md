# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification

An end-to-end machine learning workflow on the **Iris dataset** â€” including **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Model Training**, and **Evaluation**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers across three species:
- *Setosa*
- *Versicolor*
- *Virginica*

Each sample has four features:
- `sepal_length`
- `sepal_width`
- `petal_length`
- `petal_width`

The goal is to classify flowers into their correct species.

**Key Insight from EDA**  
ðŸŒ¿ Petal features (`petal_length`, `petal_width`) show the clearest separation between classes, while sepal features overlap more.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€” histograms, pairplots, and distribution checks.
- **Model Training** â€” multiple ML algorithms tested.
- **Evaluation** â€” accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## ðŸ¤– Algorithms & Cross-Validation Results
Mean accuracy Â± standard deviation across folds:

| Model | Accuracy | Std. Dev |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Logistic Regression (LR) | 94.17% | Â±6.59% |
| Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) | **97.50%** | Â±3.82% |
| K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) | 95.83% | Â±4.17% |
| Decision Tree (CART) | 94.17% | Â±5.34% |
| Naive Bayes (NB) | 95.00% | Â±5.53% |
| Support Vector Machine (SVM) | **98.33%** | Â±3.33% |

**ðŸ“Š Takeaway**:  
- **SVM** achieved the highest accuracy with low variance.  
- **LDA** performed nearly as well, with great consistency.
